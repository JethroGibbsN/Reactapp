        <p>NCIS is an American action police procedural television series, revolving around a fictional team of special agents from the Naval Criminal Investigative Service. The concept and characters were initially introduced in two episodes of the CBS series JAG (season eight episodes 20 and 21: "Ice Queen" and "Meltdown"). The show, a spin-off from JAG, premiered on September 23, 2003, on CBS. To date it has aired sixteen full seasons and has gone into broadcast syndication on the USA Network. Donald P. Bellisario and Don McGill are co-creators and executive producers of the premiere member of the NCIS franchise. As of 2019, it is the second-longest-running scripted, non-animated U.S. primetime TV series currently airing, surpassed only by Law and Order: Special Victims Unit (1999â€“present), and is the 7th-longest-running scripted U.S. primetime TV series overall.</p>
